Guidelines

1. Pick something you're passionate about. Part of the fun is seeing others' passions and sharing that excitement.

2. Acknowledge your privilege. This is especially relevant when discussing a topic where your perspective has already been offered (ex: white people talking about colonization). Do you have anything new or unique to add, or will your voice only serve to drown out others?

3. Consider accessibility. Visual aids, handouts, and other tools can help your audience to follow. Avoid using jargon, or alternatively, be prepared to explain terms that others may not be familiar with.

4. Respect your audience. This includes being mindful of peoples' pronouns. 

5. Include content warnings for your talk, if applicable. Is there sensitive content, or something that might trigger someone else? If so, please be sure to mention it before the talk so that the audience members can take any necessary steps to ensure their comfort.
