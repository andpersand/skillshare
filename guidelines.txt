Guidelines

1. Pick something you're passionate about. Part of the fun is seeing others' passions and sharing that excitement.

2. Acknowledge your privilege. This is especially important when discussing a topic where your perspective has already been offered (ex: white folks talking about colonization). While it's important for people with privilege to take on the emotional labor to tackle these topics, it's also important to consider whether your perspective is valuable. Do you have anything important to add, or will your voice only serve to drown out others?

3. Consider accessibility. Visual aids, handouts, and other tools can help your audience to follow. Avoid using jargon, or alternatively, be prepared to explain terms that others may not be familiar with.
