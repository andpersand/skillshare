- Most common locks 
- Seen in video games like Oblivion, Skyrim, and Fallout 4

# _The Goal_
- Match the break in the pins with the _sheer line_
- The _driver pins_ need to be _above the sheer line_, and the _key pins_ need to be _below the sheer line_ for the lock to open

# Tools

### Picks
- Two subtypes: **rakes** and **picks**
-- **Picks** are used to set individual pins
-- **Rakes** are used to 'rake' the pins and attempt to set multiple pins in one go

### Torsion (or Tension) Wrench
- Used to slightly rotate the plug while you're setting the pins
- Also used to rotate the plug and open the lock

# Tools

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Lockpicks.jpg/510px-Lockpicks.jpg "Lockpicking Tools")

Tools from L-R: torsion wrench, "twist-flex" torsion wrench, offset diamond pick, ball pick, half-diamond pick, short hook, medium hook, saw (or "L") rake, snake (or "C") rake.

# Technique

1. Pick a pick
2. Pick a wrench
3. Test the pins with your pick
4. Select a pin and attempt to set it
5. Continue to set pins until all are set
6. Once all pins are set, rotate the torsion wrench to open the lock

# NEW SKILL UNLOCKED!!

#### Congratulations! You're a badass!

If you don't unlock the lock on your first try, **don't worry!** Picking a lock can take a long time, even if you've picked 100+ locks in your life.
